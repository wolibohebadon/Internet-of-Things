##IETF CoAP協定

[Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) draft-ietf-core-coap-18](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-18)

>  The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.  The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.
